Description: Motorcycle suspension dyno testing software
 Shockee is a comprehensive motorcycle suspension testing application
 that works with Arduino-based dyno hardware to provide real-time
 analysis of suspension performance.
 .
 Features include:
  * Real-time data collection from Arduino sensors
  * Load cell, position, and encoder measurements
  * Velocity calculations and damping analysis
  * Session recording and data export
  * Comparison charts and analysis tools
  * Calibration utilities for sensor accuracy
 .
 The application communicates with Arduino Uno R3 hardware at 9600 baud
 to collect sensor data at 100Hz for professional suspension tuning.
